# Claude Code Execution Prompt for Phase 2 Implementation

**COPY & PASTE THIS PROMPT TO CLAUDE CODE (After Phase 1 Complete):**

---

I need you to coordinate the implementation of improvements using the @workflow-orchestrator agent. This is Phase 2 based on Phase 1 assessment findings.

## **Project Details:**
- Portfolio location: `C:\xampp\htdocs\ALI_PORTFOLIO\`
- Assessment reports (READ FROM): `C:\xampp\htdocs\ALI_PORTFOLIO\.claude\outputs\reports\PHASE-1\`
- Progress tracking (SAVE TO): `C:\xampp\htdocs\ALI_PORTFOLIO\.claude\outputs\analysis\`
- Final reports (SAVE TO): `C:\xampp\htdocs\ALI_PORTFOLIO\.claude\outputs\reports\PHASE-2\`
- Use @workflow-orchestrator as main coordinator

## **Input Requirements:**
Before starting, read these Phase 1 outputs from reports/PHASE-1/:
- `master-assessment-report.md` 
- `priority-matrix.json`
- `improvement-roadmap.md`

## **Implementation Sequence:**

### **Priority 1: Critical Security Fixes**

## **@workflow-orchestrator Responsibilities:**

### **1. Parse Phase 1 Findings:**
```
Read from reports/PHASE-1/: 
- master-assessment-report.md (executive summary & correlations)
- priority-matrix.json (implementation priorities)
- improvement-roadmap.md (strategic sequence)
Extract: Critical issues, dependencies, success metrics
Plan: Implementation sequence with quality gates
```

### **2. Coordinate Implementation:**
```
Deploy agents by priority (1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3A+3B â†’ 4)
Monitor progress and dependencies
Validate quality gates before next priority
Handle conflicts and coordinate recovery
Save coordination tracking to analysis/implementation-log.md
```

### **3. Generate Reports:**
```
Progress Tracking (save to analysis/):
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation-log.md           â†’ Complete coordination history

Final Reports (save to reports/PHASE-2/):
â”œâ”€â”€ quality-gate-results.md        â†’ All checkpoint validations
â”œâ”€â”€ final-improvement-report.md     â†’ Summary of all improvements
â””â”€â”€ before-after-metrics.json      â†’ Quantified improvements
```

## **Success Criteria:**
- âœ… All Priority 1 & 2 issues resolved (Critical + High)
- âœ… 80% of Priority 3 issues completed (Medium)
- âœ… 60% of Priority 4 issues completed (Low)
- âœ… All quality gates passed with validation
- âœ… Progress tracking properly saved to analysis/
- âœ… Final summary reports completed in reports/PHASE-2/

**Please execute this implementation workflow using @workflow-orchestrator as coordinator. Each specialist agent must read their specific input reports from reports/PHASE-1/ and save their progress to analysis/, with final reports going to reports/PHASE-2/.**
