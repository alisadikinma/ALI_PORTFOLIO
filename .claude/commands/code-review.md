## LARAVEL MVC ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

**CRITICAL**: This is a Laravel project. Evaluate MVC implementation and Laravel best practices extensively.

### MVC ARCHITECTURE CHECKLIST:

#### **üìÅ MODELS (app/Models/)**
- ‚úÖ **Eloquent Best Practices**: Proper model relationships, fillable/guarded properties
- ‚úÖ **Single Responsibility**: Each model handles one entity/concept
- ‚úÖ **Relationships**: Correct use of hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Attributes**: Proper mutators, accessors, and casts
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Model-level validation rules if applicable
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Check migrations for proper foreign keys, indexes

#### **üéÆ CONTROLLERS (app/Http/Controllers/)**
- ‚úÖ **Thin Controllers**: Business logic moved to services/repositories
- ‚úÖ **Resource Controllers**: RESTful methods (index, show, create, store, edit, update, destroy)
- ‚úÖ **Request Validation**: Using Form Request classes or validate() method
- ‚úÖ **Single Responsibility**: Each controller handles one resource/concept
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI instead of static calls
- ‚úÖ **Response Patterns**: Consistent JSON/view responses

#### **üëÅÔ∏è VIEWS (resources/views/)**
- ‚úÖ **Blade Templates**: Proper use of layouts, components, partials
- ‚úÖ **Template Inheritance**: @extends, @section, @yield usage
- ‚úÖ **Component Architecture**: Reusable Blade components
- ‚úÖ **Data Presentation**: Logic-free views, data formatting in controllers/models
- ‚úÖ **Asset Organization**: CSS/JS properly organized and compiled

#### **üõ£Ô∏è ROUTES (routes/)**
- ‚úÖ **Route Organization**: web.php vs api.php separation
- ‚úÖ **Route Groups**: Proper middleware, prefix, namespace grouping
- ‚úÖ **Resource Routes**: Using Route::resource() where appropriate
- ‚úÖ **Route Model Binding**: Implicit/explicit binding usage
- ‚úÖ **Middleware Usage**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting

#### **‚öôÔ∏è SERVICES & REPOSITORIES**
- ‚úÖ **Service Layer**: Business logic extracted from controllers
- ‚úÖ **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction if used
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection**: Proper service container usage
- ‚úÖ **Interface Segregation**: Service contracts/interfaces

#### **üîß LARAVEL ECOSYSTEM**
- ‚úÖ **Middleware**: Custom middleware properly implemented
- ‚úÖ **Form Requests**: Validation logic separated
- ‚úÖ **Observers/Events**: Model events handled properly
- ‚úÖ **Artisan Commands**: Custom commands if any
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Config files properly used vs hardcoded values

Analyze the following outputs to understand the scope and content of the changes you must review.

GIT STATUS:

```
!`git status`
```

FILES MODIFIED:

```
!`git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
```

COMMITS:

```
!`git log --no-decorate origin/HEAD...`
```

DIFF CONTENT:

```
!`git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD`
```

Review the complete diff above. This contains all code changes in the PR.


OBJECTIVE:
Use the pragmatic-code-review agent to comprehensively review the complete diff above, focusing on Laravel MVC architecture and best practices. Your final reply must contain the markdown report with MVC compliance assessment.

## EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:

### **üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT**
For each changed file, evaluate:
1. **MVC Compliance**: Does it follow proper MVC separation?
2. **Laravel Conventions**: Follows Laravel naming and structure conventions?
3. **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.
4. **Code Organization**: Files in correct directories, proper namespacing

### **üìä MVC SCORING CRITERIA**

**Models (0-10 points each):**
- Proper Eloquent relationships
- Appropriate use of fillable/guarded
- Model-specific business logic only
- Proper attribute casting

**Controllers (0-10 points each):**
- Thin controllers (business logic in services)
- Proper request validation
- RESTful method implementation
- Consistent response patterns

**Views (0-10 points each):**
- Logic-free templates
- Proper Blade syntax usage
- Component reusability
- Clean separation of concerns

**Routes (0-10 points each):**
- Proper route organization
- Middleware implementation
- Resource route usage
- Route model binding

### **‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS TO CHECK**
- Business logic in views/controllers
- Direct database queries in controllers
- Hardcoded values instead of config
- Missing validation
- Poor error handling
- Security vulnerabilities
- N+1 query problems
- Missing CSRF protection
