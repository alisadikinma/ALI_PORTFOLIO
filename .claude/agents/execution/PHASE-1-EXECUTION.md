## **FINAL REMINDER TO ALL AGENTS:**

**DO NOT SKIP THE ADMIN PANEL** - This is a complete Laravel application with both frontend and backend. Your assessment is INCOMPLETE if you only review the public-facing pages. Make sure to:

1. **Access the admin dashboard** at `/dashboard`
2. **Test all admin functionality** (CRUD operations, file uploads, user management)
3. **Analyze admin-specific security, performance, and usability**
4. **Include admin findings in your reports**

**Please execute this comprehensive assessment with @knowledge-synthesizer as coordinator. All reports must cover the COMPLETE system including both frontend and admin functionality.**
