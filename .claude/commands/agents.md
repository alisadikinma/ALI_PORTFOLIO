## Best Practices for Agent Usage

### **1. Be Specific with Context**
‚ùå Bad: `@frontend-developer Fix my CSS`
‚úÖ Good: `@frontend-developer Fix the tablet responsive layout in the project showcase section - navigation overlaps content at 768px viewport`

### **2. Provide Relevant Code/Files**
Always mention specific files, components, or code sections the agent should focus on.

### **3. Mention Your Portfolio Context**
Agents are aware of your Laravel 10.49.0 portfolio project, but specific context helps:
- Which page/component you're working on
- Current issues or constraints
- Target devices or browsers
- Performance requirements

### **4. Use Sequential Agent Calls for Complex Tasks**
For complex changes, call agents in logical sequence:
1. First: Planning agent (@laravel-specialist for backend, @ui-designer for design)
2. Then: Implementation agent (@frontend-developer, @laravel-specialist)
3. Finally: Review agents (@code-reviewer, @qa-expert)

### **5. Leverage Agent Expertise**
Each agent has deep expertise in their domain. Don't hesitate to ask for:
- Best practice recommendations
- Architecture suggestions
- Performance optimization tips
- Security considerations
- Design improvements
