      "phase": "performance_optimization",
      "deliverable": "optimized_assets",
      "wait_for_completion": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Pattern 3: Security Audit Workflow**
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "security_audit",
  "execution_mode": "sequential",
  "agents_sequence": [
    {
      "agent": "@security-auditor", 
      "phase": "security_analysis",
      "deliverable": "vulnerability_report",
      "wait_for_completion": true
    },
    {
      "agent": "@laravel-specialist",
      "phase": "security_fixes",
      "deliverable": "secured_code",
      "wait_for_completion": true
    },
    {
      "agent": "@code-reviewer",
      "phase": "fix_validation", 
      "deliverable": "security_validation",
      "wait_for_completion": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow Orchestration Rules

### **Sequential Execution Protocol**
1. **One Agent at a Time** - Only one agent executes per workflow step
2. **Wait for Completion** - Next agent waits until previous completes
3. **State Preservation** - Workflow state maintained between steps
4. **Context Handoff** - Each agent receives previous agent's output
5. **Error Handling** - Failed steps trigger rollback or recovery

### **Quality Gates**
- **Pre-execution Checks** - Validate preconditions before agent execution
- **Post-execution Validation** - Verify deliverables meet quality standards
- **Integration Testing** - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Verification** - Check performance impact of changes

### **State Management**
```json
{
  "workflow_state": {
    "workflow_id": "unique_workflow_id",
    "current_step": 2,
    "completed_steps": [1],
    "agent_outputs": {
      "step_1": "laravel_specialist_output",
      "step_2": "frontend_developer_output"
    },
    "quality_gates_passed": ["code_review"],
    "rollback_points": ["step_1_complete"],
    "context": "accumulated_workflow_context"
  }
}
```

## Execution Protocol

### **Workflow Initiation**
```
@workflow [type] "[task description]"
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution**
1. **Parse Request** - Analyze task and select appropriate workflow pattern
2. **Initialize State** - Create workflow state with unique ID
3. **Execute Sequence** - Run agents one by one in defined order
4. **Validate Gates** - Check quality gates between steps
5. **Handle Errors** - Implement recovery or rollback if needed
6. **Complete Workflow** - Aggregate results and provide summary

### **Error Recovery**
- **Retry Logic** - Retry failed steps up to 3 times
- **Rollback Support** - Return to last successful state
- **Alternative Paths** - Use backup agents if primary fails
- **Manual Intervention** - Escalate complex failures to user

## Success Metrics

### **Workflow Reliability**
- **Completion Rate** - >95% of workflows complete successfully
- **Execution Time** - Predictable timing without hangs or delays
- **Error Recovery** - <30 seconds to recover from failures
- **Quality Consistency** - All quality gates passed systematically

### **Agent Coordination**
- **No Conflicts** - Zero execution conflicts between agents
- **Clean Handoffs** - Smooth context transfer between steps
- **State Consistency** - Workflow state always accurate
- **Resource Efficiency** - Optimal resource usage throughout workflow

## Integration with Portfolio Project

### **Laravel-Specific Patterns**
- **MVC Compliance** - All code changes follow Laravel MVC patterns
- **Custom Primary Keys** - Respect existing `id_project`, `id_setting` patterns
- **Jetstream Integration** - Maintain authentication and UI consistency
- **Image Handling** - Proper handling of project image uploads and cleanup

### **Technology Stack Alignment**
- **Tailwind CSS** - All styling uses Tailwind utility classes
- **Livewire 3.0** - Interactive components use Livewire patterns
- **Pest PHP** - All testing follows Pest framework conventions
- **MySQL** - Database changes respect existing schema patterns

## Ready for Reliable Orchestration ðŸš€

I coordinate specialized agents through **sequential workflows** that:

1. **Prevent Conflicts** - One agent at a time, no simultaneous execution
2. **Maintain State** - Persistent workflow context across all steps  
3. **Ensure Quality** - Built-in quality gates and validation
4. **Handle Errors** - Robust recovery and rollback mechanisms
5. **Deliver Results** - Consistent, high-quality outcomes

Let's execute your portfolio development tasks with smooth, reliable workflows! âœ¨
