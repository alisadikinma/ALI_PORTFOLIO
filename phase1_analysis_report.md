**Workflow ID**: comprehensive_portfolio_refactor_20250922
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-22
**Analysis Team**: Workflow Orchestrator + Laravel Specialist + UI Designer

## 🏗️ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT

### Laravel Backend Architecture (STRONG FOUNDATION)
✅ **STRENGTHS**:
- Laravel 10.49.0 with Jetstream (Livewire 3.0)

- LookupData model for flexible configuration
- Comprehensive caching strategy
- Homepage sections management with service layer
- Proper Model-View-Controller separation

⚠️ **AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**:
- Mixed usage of direct DB queries vs Eloquent models
- Some controllers still use raw queries for performance
- HomepageSectionService could be more robust
- Image optimization could be enhanced
